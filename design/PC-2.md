Title: REST API paredown to remove the /notification series
Synopsis: Remove the notification system from the reference design

# Proposal

Shall the notification system from the reference design?

There will be no consumer notification in the PrivacyChain v1.5 demonstrator.
At best direct-to-consumer notification is "deferred" or is "delegated" to a brand-badged sponsor (<em>e.g.</em> YourCompoanyNameHERE).
