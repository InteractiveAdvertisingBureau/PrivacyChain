| Synopsis | Operating a distributed system over a long period of time |

# Proposal

Whereas it is insufficient to operate based upon "whatever code is in Docker, today" a more deliberate approach to software supply chain management

The "releases" of Hyperledger Fabric are intended to provide for supply chain guarantees against this code base.
* hotfix capability against security or operability problems
* continued availability of the artifacts across the service lifetime.

The system is dependent upon many other packages.

# Scope

Any software needed to run the system

# Span

## Document
* Dependent packages

## Propose
* Software supply chain for multi-year availability guarantees
* Chain-of-custody of software artifacts

## Produce
* CI/CD Pipeline
